# GitHub Setup Instructions

## ✅ What We've Done

1. ✅ Created fresh clean Git repository
2. ✅ Only source code committed (28 files, 4964 lines)
3. ✅ All large files properly gitignored
4. ✅ Ready to push!

## 🔗 Next: Add Your GitHub Remote

You need to tell me your GitHub repository URL, then we can push.

### Step 1: Get Your GitHub URL

**If you already have a GitHub repo for this project:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name
2. Click green "Code" button
3. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo.git`)

**If you need to create a new repo:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `ranjana-ocr` (or whatever you want)
3. Set to **Private** or **Public** (your choice)
4. **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Copy the HTTPS URL shown

### Step 2: Give Me The URL

Tell me your GitHub repository URL and I'll:
1. Add it as remote origin
2. Rename branch to `main` (GitHub standard)
3. Push clean code to GitHub
4. Done! 🎉
