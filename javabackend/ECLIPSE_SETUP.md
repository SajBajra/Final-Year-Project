# 🔧 Eclipse Setup Guide - Java Backend

## ⚠️ Important: Use Eclipse, Not Command Line

If you're using Eclipse IDE, you should build and run the project **from Eclipse**, not from the command line!

**If you see this error:**
```
[ERROR] No goals have been specified for this build.
```

**This means:** You ran `mvn` from command line without a goal. Since you're using Eclipse, ignore this and follow the Eclipse steps below instead.
